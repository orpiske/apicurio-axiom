# Apitomy Axiom

An event-driven project orchestration platform that monitors GitHub and Jira issues, creates
long-lived projects around them, and delegates work to human and AI actors.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Triage** — an AI Manager triages incoming events and decides what actions to take
- **Human + AI Actors** — pluggable actor system supports Claude Code, OpenCode, and human actors
- **Project Lifecycle** — long-lived projects track work from triage through completion
- **Event Sources** — watches GitHub and Jira repositories via webhooks or polling
- **Web Dashboard** — React + PatternFly UI with real-time SSE updates
- **Pluggable AI Engines** — swap between Claude Code CLI and OpenCode without code changes

## Architecture Overview

Axiom is built as a multi-module Quarkus application:

```
events/          → Event sources (GitHub, Jira) poll or receive webhooks
  ↓
manager/         → AI Manager triages events and creates tasks
  ↓
actors/          → Actors (Claude Code, OpenCode, Human) execute tasks
  ↓
core/            → Domain entities, project lifecycle, workspace management
  ↓
app/             → Quarkus application assembles everything
ui/              → React frontend provides visibility and configuration
```
