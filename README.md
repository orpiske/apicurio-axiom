# Apitomy Axiom

Event-driven project orchestration platform that monitors GitHub and Jira issues, creates
long-lived projects around them, and delegates work to human and AI actors.

## What It Does

- Watches GitHub/Jira repositories for issue activity (webhooks or polling)
- An AI Manager triages events and decides what actions to take
- Tasks are assigned to Actors (AI agents or humans)
- Projects track the full lifecycle of work tied to each issue
- A UI provides visibility into projects, tasks, activity, and configuration

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| Backend | Java 25 / Quarkus 3.33 LTS |
| Frontend | TypeScript / React / PatternFly |
| Database | H2 (in-memory dev, file-based prod) |
| AI | Pluggable: Claude Code CLI or OpenCode (configurable) |
| API | Contract-first OpenAPI + apitomy-codegen |

## AI Engine

Axiom's AI engine is pluggable. Set `axiom.ai-engine` in `application.properties` to
select which engine to use:

| Engine | Config Value | Binary | Install |
|--------|-------------|--------|---------|
| Claude Code | `claude-code` (default) | `claude` | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` |
| OpenCode | `opencode` | `opencode` | `curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install \| bash` |

Only the selected engine's binary needs to be installed. Both can coexist for testing.

## Prerequisites

- Java 25+
- Maven 3.9+
- Node.js 20+ (for UI and MCP tool server)
- One of the AI engine CLIs (see table above)
- API key for your LLM provider (e.g. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)

## Build

```bash
# Standard build (backend only, no UI)
./build.sh

# Release build (backend + UI bundled into uber-jar)
./build-release.sh
```

## Development

```bash
# Backend (Quarkus dev mode with H2)
cd app && mvn quarkus:dev

# Frontend (Vite dev server, proxies API to localhost:8080)
cd ui && npm install && npm run dev
```

## Database Migrations (Flyway)

Schema migrations are managed by [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/) and run automatically on
startup for persistent databases (the `persist` and `prod` profiles). Migration files are
located in `app/src/main/resources/db/migration/`.

### How it works

- **Dev mode** (`quarkus:dev`): Uses Hibernate's `drop-and-create` — no Flyway, schema is
  recreated on every restart. Fast for development.
- **Persist/Prod mode**: Flyway runs migrations at startup. Hibernate schema generation is
  set to `none` — Flyway owns the schema.

### Adding a new migration

1. Create a new SQL file in `app/src/main/resources/db/migration/` following the naming
   convention: `V<number>__<description>.sql` (e.g. `V3__add_priority_to_task.sql`)
2. Write standard SQL DDL statements. Use `IF NOT EXISTS` / `IF EXISTS` guards for safety.
3. The migration runs automatically on the next startup of a persistent database.

### Existing databases

Flyway is configured with `baseline-on-migrate=true` and `baseline-version=1`. This means
existing databases that were created before Flyway was introduced will be automatically
baselined — Flyway skips V1 (the full schema creation) and applies only new migrations
(V2+).

### Example migration

```sql
-- V3__add_priority_to_task.sql
ALTER TABLE task ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS priority VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT 'normal';
```
