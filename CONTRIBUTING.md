7. **Push to your fork** and submit a pull request

## Development Setup

See the [README](README.md) for installation and setup instructions.

### Building and Testing

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues automatically
npm run lint:fix
```

## Coding Standards

- Follow the existing code style in the project
- Code is formatted and linted with [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/)
- Run `npm run lint` before committing to ensure code quality
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or bug fix
- Include a clear description of what the PR does and why
- Link to any related issues
- Ensure the PR passes all CI checks (linting, building)
- Update CHANGELOG.md if your changes are user-facing

## Code Review

All submissions require review before being merged. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose.

## Commit Message Format

We use conventional commit messages for clarity and automated changelog generation:
